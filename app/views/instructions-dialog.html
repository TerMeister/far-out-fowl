  <b>Why did the giant space chicken cross the GALAXY?  Wo cares, welcome to
  Far Out Fowl!</b>
  <br><br>
  The cosmic destroyer, a fowl beast (get it?!?) has launched an all-out attack
  on the Earth.  It's up to you, chicken farmer Joe, to defeat this menace from
  beyond the stars!
</div>

<div id="instructions_divPage2" style="display:none;">
  Catch the poison eggs the chicken
  drops before they splatter and release their toxins upon the world.
  <br><br>
  Control your basket by pressing the Q and P keys to move
  left and right, or tap the left and right sides of the screen, or
  tilt your device left and right.
</div>

<div id="instructions_divPage3" style="display:none;">
  You also have available to you a missile system with which to attack the
  chicken.  Hitting the chicken causes it to pause temporarily.
  <br><br>
  Fire your missile by pressing space bar or flicking your device forward.
  Note that you can only have a single missile in flight at a time.
</div>

<div id="instructions_divPage4" style="display:none;">
  You get points for catching eggs and hitting the chicken.
  Splattered eggs cost points and damage your basket.  Too much damage
  ends the game.  Missile strikes on the chicken repairs your basket
  a bit.
  <br><br>
  Click Start whenever you're ready Joe and get to saving the world!
